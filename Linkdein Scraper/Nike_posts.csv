"Jordan Brand knows that basketball has the power to fearlessly challenge the most impactful issues of our day, including systemic racism. But real change is possible only with a more complete understanding of how structural racism has impacted American history. To spark change at the local level, the Jordan Black Community Commitment (BCC) opened its annual Community Grants cycle this November, awarding grassroots nonprofits across America. Applications are open now through December 16. Qualified organizations can access the application at https://lnkd.in/gEnw_bBn In November, the Jordan BCC came together to celebrate a new collective of grantee organizations elevating stories of the Black experience during Breaking Bread – an intimate two-day gathering in New York City that brought together new and existing storytelling partners as well as Jordan BCC family members, award-winning authors and leading scholars for the first time. Employees at Jordan Brand are part of this very same family. At the heart of the Jordan BCC is the desire to unite Jordan Brand family members to take action where it’s needed most nationally. That bond is driven by action and shaped by a spirit of excellence to make real, tangible change. “The Black Community has been the guardian of its own history for centuries in America, so this was an important moment for us to honor the tradition of storytelling that has protected this heritage, used change to heal and inspire joy, and celebrated the spirit of family that continues to advance the missions of the Jordan Black Community Commitment,” says Sarah Mensah, Jordan Brand President.Read more at https://lnkd.in/gSPBrHqfhashtag#JordanBCC hashtag#BreakingBread hashtag#JordanBrand

"Coveted retro? There’s a coveted job behind every pair.The employees who bring the Jordan Brand retro line to market every season feel a special responsibility in their day-to-day work, from shoe design to marketing to supply chain. The goal is the same: Help pass on the legacy of the Jumpman for a new generation. The spring 2024 collection was revealed today (Check out the AJ IV Bred Reimagined below 👀 ). Behind much of the work were people like Itchelle Mapanao, Senior Product Line Manager (PLM) for Jordan Brand Women’s. Being a PLM at Jordan Brand is her dream job, she says, as she sits at the intersection of history that honors the man himself and forward-thinking vision for younger generations of Jordan Brand fans, especially women. One of her most rewarding moments came during her team’s recent market trip to Paris.“We were walking through the streets of Paris, and I saw a teenage girl walk by wearing a pair of the Air Jordan IV Oil Greens that we released last year,” says Mapanao. “I was blown away by how well she styled the outfit with her shoe— it was this beautiful mix of blues and greens. But more than that, I loved seeing how confident she looked as she walked by. Seeing women all over the world pair their unique style with our sneakers is magical. They beam with this confidence that you only get when wearing a pair of Js. I take a lot of pride in getting to help foster a love for Jordan Brand style among young women.”Check out the spring 2024 Jordan Brand retro collection: https://lnkd.in/gRG2y5n5hashtag#Jumpman hashtag#JordanBrand hashtag#NIkeCareers

"At Nike, we believe basketball is more than just a game. It’s an opportunity to break barriers, build community and expand sport for the next generation. The newest N7 collection celebrates the power of the sport within the Indigenous community, something that hits close to home for Nike N7 General Manager Sam McCracken, a member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes — and a former girls basketball coach at the high school level for more than 30 years throughout the Western United States.Through his current work with Nike N7, McCracken is committed to help give more Indigenous kids a chance to play basketball and other sports. The N7 Fund provides grants — administered by CAF America — to nonprofits that create youth access to sport in Indigenous communities across North America. This investment continues Nike’s legacy of support for Indigenous communities through the N7 Fund and other grants, totaling over $10.8 million to nearly 300 organizations since 2009.Two of our N7 Fund grantees — the Notah Begay III (NB3) Foundation  and Rise Above — are using the investment to help grow the game for girls. This year, NB3 created its first basketball team for Native American girls (ages 10-13), with an Indigenous woman as its head coach. Rise Above hosted multiple youth basketball clinics and has plans for an all-girls camp next summer.Coincidentally, Rise Above’s Co-Founder, Jaci McCormack, competed as a player against one of McCracken’s varsity girls high school teams in Beaverton, Ore. They may have been on opposing teams, but a shared passion for basketball and their community instantly connected them, says McCracken. “I’m so proud of the impact Jaci’s making, not only on young girls, but on so many kids in our community,” he says.Learn more about how Nike’s tapping into the power of basketball and other sports to level the playing field and build active, inclusive communities at https://lnkd.in/dkRgfFCxhashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#NativeAmericanHeritageMonth hashtag#NikeN7 hashtag#JustDoIt

"Offering employees the best workspaces and work experiences is a NIKE, Inc. passion — and you could feel that energy in our EMEA Headquarters this week with the reopening of the Bill Bowerman Center (BBC). Built on 1928 Olympic grounds, the BBC is a tribute to our founders’ legacy, one that champions athletic achievement and the spirit of innovation. After a full renovation with sustainability, inclusivity and accessibility at the core, the BBC now has more than 100,000 square feet to explore, including best-in-class sports facilities, immersive spaces and an array of services to support our incredible Nike team. The terrace overlooking the Eliud Kipchoge Track & Field adds the final touch — and Eliud himself joined the team for the official renaming of the track.

"“Running is more than a hobby for me — it’s a lifestyle. But it wasn’t until I was diagnosed with a mild heart disease almost four years ago that I realized how integral running is to my very being.” That’s Naoe Tanaka, Head Coach of Nike Ginza, the new Nike Rise store in the middle of downtown Tokyo. This location is in the heart of one of Japan’s most vibrant running communities, which Nike Ginza is specifically designed to serve through a variety of in-store features and programming. Tanaka’s passion for running led her to start working for Nike last year, and the camaraderie she’s found in the local running community has grounded her work in a deeper sense of purpose, she says. After the frightening diagnosis she mentioned above, she doubled down on finding ways to connect with other runners on what the sport gave her: Hope, healing, adventure and solidarity. And that's what the running programming at Nike Ginza is all about. Through regular events, like Nike Run Club Live group runs, Nike Ginza provides Tokyo’s runners a space where they can savor movement with each other. “Running with other people is something I started doing seriously once I joined the Nike family,” says Tanaka. “I remember my first staff run with my co-workers and feeling at home, supported and motivated in a way I’d never experienced before. What makes Nike so special is the sense of connection to others, and I've felt it firsthand. That’s exactly what I want people to feel when they come to our store: a shared spark that makes you want to redefine what you think is possible.” Read more about Nike Ginza at https://lnkd.in/gQg-gHgdhashtag#NikeGinza hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt

"Climate change is one of the most existential threats to sport we will ever face. And we know it isn’t just a sports issue — it’s a community issue too. That’s why Nike launched the Community Climate Resilience Program (CCRP) to help provide access to urban green spaces and parks and increase sports participation in the communities that need it most. In the year since CCRP launched, Nike has worked with Trust for Public Land to transform more than 117,000 square feet of public park space in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, serving nearly 100,000 adults and children. The positive outcomes have had a powerful impact on the employees working on the project too. “In some cases, we’re going into neighborhoods that are park deserts without walkable access to real green space. By creating and opening these spaces, we’re unlocking the first real public parks for many members of these communities,” says Patrick Reaves, Nike Director of Business Integration for Social and Community Impact, who’s helped lead the program. “The site visits have been especially meaningful. Going from brainstorming this project in our office to seeing tangible change — a finished green schoolyard for a community — is incredibly rewarding. And given the scale of climate inequity, I hope it's a catalyst for even more positive impact.""

"Nike’s disability community is key to our success and brings creativity, diversity of thought and lived experiences to everything we create. Simply put, disability is a strength.To recognize Disability Employee Awareness Month in October, we celebrated Nike’s inaugural Accessibility Summit, produced by the Disability Network and the Accessibility Center of Excellence. The Summit brought people together from across the company to share employee stories, learn about innovative accessible product and show how Nike builds a disability-inclusive workplace.A key moment of the summit featured a panel with Tobie Hatfield discussing his work for more than three decades in designing accessible sneakers with people with disabilities. For Hatfield, centering the product on athlete feedback has always been core to Nike’s philosophy.“Listening to the voice of the athlete is not just their voice, but it’s their mannerisms, it’s their character, it’s all of it,” says Hatfield, Nike’s Senior Director of Athlete Innovation. “At Nike, the ‘voice’ is emblematic of the whole athlete and the whole person.""Learn more about Nike’s Disability Network and other employment opportunities at: https://lnkd.in/gkfjbuBX hashtag#DisabiltyIsAStrength hashtag#DisabilityEmploymentAwarenessMonth hashtag#NDEAM hashtag#NikeAccessibilitySummit hashtag#InclusionDrivesInnovation

"Virgil Abloh was one of one. According to those who knew him best, the artist and designer most closely identified with skate in reflecting his creative principles through sport. The second annual Abloh Invitational, which took place this weekend in Miami, celebrated Virgil's enduring legacy and his love for the skate community. The two-day event featured freeriding sessions, competitions, community service opportunities, art exhibitions and more.For Leo Sandino-Taylor, Nike VP of Catalyst Brand Management, Virgil’s ease in bringing different social circles together — from artists to athletes to cultural figures — speaks to his special ability to connect with people, including his Nike teammates.“Virgil’s legacy lives on,” says Sandino-Taylor. “By hosting a second event like this with our SB athletes and Virgil’s nearest and dearest speaks to the deep relationship we had with him here at Nike. He wasn’t only our creative peer, but our friend.

"Every year, one of NIKE, Inc.’s most important beliefs — that all kids should have the opportunity to play, regardless of background, gender or ability — comes to life right here on our WHQ campus.Through Nike’s longtime partnership with Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR), we had the privilege of hosting the SOOR Games last weekend, an opportunity to help introduce sport to nearly 500 young athletes with intellectual disabilities while celebrating the joy of movement with them and their families. And just as many Nike employees show up as volunteers. The SOOR Games is one of the fastest -filled employee volunteer events at our company. For many, the experience is an all-time Nike highlight, including for Paige La Flamme, a Nike Business Operations and Planning Lead in Technology Management, who also Co-Chairs Nike’s Disability Network. La Flamme says it’s only fitting that Nike’s spirit of volunteerism is so strong at the event. “The Special Olympics Youth Games is one of my favorite days of the year,” says La Flamme. “As a previous Special Olympics Oregon Intern, this organization and most importantly, the athletes, have a special place in my heart. It's amazing to see the power of the Nike Community come together to celebrate and show the collective strength of disability and the importance of sport through this event.”The SOOR Games are only one example of NIKE, Inc.’s commitment to support accessibility and disability. In honor of National Disability Employment Awareness Month, Nike’s Disability Employee Network will lead a number of events in October that highlight the company’s dedicated hiring programs and the ways in which Nike is increasing accessibility for employees of every background.Learn more about Nike’s employee networks at https://lnkd.in/gcxyit3Shashtag#LifeAtNike hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#Nike hashtag#SOOR

"The Doernbecher Freestyle XIX Collection releases this Saturday, December 2. The launch includes six of the most creative, imaginative footwear designs you’ll see all year, each of them designed by six young patients from Oregon Health & Science University Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, Ore., along with a team of Nike creatives. To say it’s one of the most popular volunteer opportunities at NIKE, Inc. is an understatement.  Joining the design process this year was Leslie Howerton, a Senior Manager in Material Operations at the Bowerman Footwear Lab. Her passion for the event is deeply personal. Almost three years ago, her 7-year-old daughter, Winnie, passed away after a long battle with leukemia, and she was treated primarily at Doernbecher. “For these kids who are going through treatment, in the middle of a nightmare they had no say over, they finally have a sense of control over something,” says Leslie about the Freestyle program. “Our Nike teams are here to help make their creative vision a reality, but the kids are in the driver’s seat. The Freestyle process is a great example of what happens when creative outlets put power back into the hands of kids.”Never underestimate the power of some cool shoes, says Leslie. She saw that first-hand with Winnie. As she was receiving treatment, Winnie received a pair of custom Air Force 1s with pink, sparkly rainbows and unicorns on them — lovingly designed by Leslie’s Nike teammates in the Bowerman Footwear Lab. Leslie remembers how Doernbecher’s nurses would walk into Winnie’s room and shower her with compliments on the shoes. Winnie would smile, saying how the design was the only one, and adding that the shoes made her feel famous.“That’s what shoes can do,” says Leslie. “These Freestyle patient designers get to step outside of their medical situation and feel famous, too.”Learn more about the Doernbecher Freestyle XIX Collection at: https://lnkd.in/g5Snvbsahashtag#DoernbecherFreestyle hashtag#OHSU hashtag#SwooshLife

"When Sam McCracken, Founder and General Manager of Nike N7, and Pearl Jam co-founder and bassist Jeff Ament — both rockstars for the Indigenous community — first met, the two visionaries from Montana knew they could create something magical together.  Jeff’s nonprofit, Montana Pool Service (MPS), builds skateparks and connects communities in the West through skateboarding and the arts. So, partnering with Nike to construct a world-class skatepark that would coincide with the opening of two new N7 basketball courts at Standing Rock Indian Reservation this summer seemed like the perfect next step.Through the combined efforts of MPS, Nike’s Native American & Friends Network (NAN, of which Sam is co-chair) and the N7 Fund, both facilities opened in June, providing a safe outlet for local youth to express themselves through movement, get outside, connect with their culture, and strengthen the community. More than 700 people showed up to celebrate, including NAN members who were thrilled to serve the kids and community as volunteers.“The opportunity to give back and invest in my community while also pursuing my own career goals is one of the greatest things about working for Nike. It’s what makes this place special, and it gives me a sense of purpose in my work,” says Tyler Hogan, Business Operations Manager, NA RSG, and NAN co-chair, who took the lead in planning the opening and made it a priority to partner closely with members of the community throughout.  Partners in the Standing Rock community who helped make this possible included Oúŋ, a community development nonprofit led by Executive Director Billi Jo Behler, and N7 Ambassador Shauna Long, whose organization Healthy Hoops offers basketball clinics and camps for kids in Standing Rock. They also worked with Grey Willow Media, a tribally-owned sound/production company, and Sweet T’s food truck. Nike N7 and OKC Thunder DJ Emcee One kept the energy up, while Indigenous photographer Tyrell Ironeyes chronicled the community moments.“Having access to world-class facilities like these is a gamechanger for kids in the Standing Rock community — to help unlock their potential through play and sport — and our NAN members were critically important to making it all happen,” says Sam. “It was such a powerful experience to be there and see how we can all show up together, both as Indigenous people and Native American employees at Nike.”hashtag#NikeN7 hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#SwooshLife

"Recently, the Nike team noticed that the majority of women logging their first workout on the Nike Run Club app were averaging a 13-minute mile. But they weren’t just running at that pace — they were fluctuating between walking, jogging, running, starting and stopping throughout their activity.This observation led to innovation — Nike Motiva, a new shoe designed for running, jogging and walking with more with comfort and ease. “In designing Motiva, we really went after removing distractions, addressing the discomfort that can go along with how you feel both during and after an activity,” says Dr. Emily Farina, Principal Researcher in the Nike Sport Research Lab. “The result is a shoe that can help reduce disruptions in your stride to make moving feel smoother — and, we hope, help you want to come back for more.”Here, watch how Emily and the Nike team brought Motiva to life, and see more behind-the-scenes looks at our Nike Women’s innovations at https://lnkd.in/g9uvxc8F hashtag#SwooshStories hashtag#Innovation hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#LiveWellLived

"Last month, NIKE, Inc. received an Equal Justice Award from the Legal Defense Fund (LDF) for its commitment to creating the pathways, culture and practices that represent the people it serves. The organization also recognized the work of NIKE, Inc.’s Black Community Commitment, investing in and supporting organizations addressing racial inequality for Black Americans. Ahead of the awards gala in NYC, LDF President and Director-Counsel Janai Nelson visited Nike's WHQ to talk with employees — and Nike’s first-ever Office of the General Counsel (OGC) Fellows. “As a new attorney, a big focus for me is figuring out how to achieve my career goals and gain valuable experience, while also being involved in social justice,” says OGC Fellow Brittani Gambrell, a graduate of Howard University School of Law. That’s one of the reasons she — along with OGC Fellow Jasmine Henderson, Esq., a graduate of North Carolina Central University School of Law — was thrilled to get some one-on-one time with Janai. “Only 2% of attorneys are Black women, and I often hear stories about them facing microaggressions in corporate offices and law firms. To be at a company like Nike that values the intersectionality of who I am, facilitates conversations like these and invests in the Black community, is astonishing,” says Henderson. “It makes me feel like this is somewhere I can grow and be the best version of myself.” Nike’s one-year OGC Fellowship was created to improve the legal talent pipeline from historically Black colleges and universities. “It requires excellence — the best possible legal representation we can provide — to transform our conditions in our circumstances,” says Nelson. “That’s what drives us to ensure we have necessary support, and our relationship with Nike is a great example of that.”Learn more about Nike's commitment to diverse representation at https://lnkd.in/gXRjky_rhashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#BlackCommunityCommitment hashtag#SwooshLife

And being part of a team who are supporting girls to be inspired to be in and stay in sport drives a huge internal purpose and passion for myself and the whole team. We want all girls to feel and experience the power of playing sport to build a lifetime of confidence.”Check out the video to launch “You Got This” — and find out more about how we’re supporting girls and women in sport here: https://lnkd.in/g9uvxc8F hashtag#InternationalDayOfTheGirl hashtag#PlayIsPower hashtag#YouGotThis

"Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, commemorates the day slavery ended in the United States in 1865. To celebrate, NIKE, Inc. closed today for all U.S. corporate and retail employees. The NIKE, Inc. family kicked off the celebration all of last week with special events and community gatherings spanning the U.S., including celebrations in Beaverton, Galveston, Memphis and New York. At Nike’s World Headquarters, NIKE, Inc. teammates from national retail stores, distribution centers and Nike Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI) came to campus to experience some of the Juneteenth events firsthand, headlined by an inspiring conversation between Colin Kaepernick and W. Kamau Bell on how sport culture can drive activism. The group was selected based on their answer to a fitting question: What does freedom mean to them?  Teon Lee, an Athlete Services Coach in Lancaster, Pa., said one of his favorite parts of the week was getting to meet more Nike teammates from all over the country. “It really is a family here,” says Lee. “You realize in moments like these how we’re at our best when we’re together, whether that’s in running a business or in celebrating a moment like Juneteenth.” For Desiree' Scott, a Nike Air MI Machine Operator in Florissant, Mo., being with a company that recognizes Juneteenth is personally significant. Simply put, she’s free to be herself. “With me being biracial, I sometimes struggle fitting in,” says Scott. “This hasn’t been a struggle since working at Nike. Being with a company that has led with its values has taught me how to navigate through life, inside and outside of my work.” Nike’s unique role in the cultural conversation around Juneteenth — at the center of creating change through sport — is a natural fit for Surina Conway. The Distribution Center Coordinator in Memphis, Tenn., believes sport can rally people from different walks of life and bring them together. “Sport can provide a platform for those who have no voice to create change in the world,” she says. “It’s empowering to work for a company that believes sport can impact the world in a positive way. It makes me feel limitless in giving me a space every day to advocate for change around me.” Learn more about how NIKE, Inc. creates a culture of belonging at: https://lnkd.in/ds-wqX7vhashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#Juneteenth hashtag#Juneteenth2023 hashtag#SwooshLife

"Hold up. A revolutionary midsole foam derived from aerospace engineering...appearing in Nike’s record-breaking marathon shoes…now for basketball? 👀  This is the kind of futuristic design you can expect in Nike Basketball's “Greater Than” series, which just welcomed its newest addition: the G.T. Cut 3, marking the first time our Nike ZoomX Foam has appeared in a basketball shoe. Ben DeSanno, a senior product line manager with Nike Basketball, works with a team that's empowered to use the latest Nike technology to improve what players can achieve on the court, helping them uncover every possible edge over their opponent. The debut of ZoomX Foam is a huge moment for basketball performance — but there was another part of the launch that was especially satisfying for Ben. “The G.T. Cut 3 is the first time we’ll release both a kids-specific version and a lower-priced version with similar performance benefits in mind,"" says DeSanno. “We talk a lot here about expanding access to basketball for everyone. The launch of the G.T. Cut 3 is a major way we’re doing that through product design. It’s changing the game for even more people.” Learn more about the G.T.

"Nike became a founding partner of Aspen Institute Sports & Society's Project Play a decade ago after rallying around a simple observation: Kids weren’t playing like they once were. The Project Play Summit, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last week in Colorado Springs, CO, gathered together some of the biggest thought-leaders in youth play and movement to collectively answer a simple question: What do we want to do about it?  “Ten years ago, we were focused on creating an architecture of movement for kids,” says Caitlin Morris, Vice President, Social & Community Impact, NIKE, Inc. “Bringing all these like-minded leaders in one place to share how we can give kids positive experiences in sport is one of the powerful ways Nike is helping lead the global conversation.” The Summit included panels led by other Nike senior leaders focused on innovative ways to get kids moving. Matt Geschke, Senior Director of Nike NA Social & Community Impact, led a conversation on how Nike’s building active, inclusive communities around the world, leading with a focus on girls and training more diverse female coaches. Karie Conner, Vice President and General Manager of Nike NA Kids and Accessories, explained how Nike’s Kids business invites all kids to play through age-specific products and experiences. Sam McCracken, General Manager of Nike N7, introduced a panel focused on reaching Indigenous youth through skateboarding. “It was incredible to take the Summit stage along with other senior leaders at Nike who also take play seriously,” said Caitlin. “Karie, Sam and Matt are all leading their teams to put kids at the center of their own experience, with the goal of creating a future of sport where everyone feels they belong.” What does play mean to some of our leaders and athletes?

"Last week, Nike employees came together for Ascend Fest, a celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month (AAPIHM). The festival, which was organized by the volunteer-led Ascend Employee Network, featured a fashion show, food, panel interviews, music and more — all recognizing the ways in which Nike is made better by its AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) communities. The Ascend Network even created a special exhibition from the Department of Nike Archives presenting a stacked lineup of shoes and apparel to show off the influence of the AAPI community on Nike’s product history 🔥. These festivities served as the bridge from Arab American Heritage Month in April, where the Ascend MENA (Middle East and North Africa) communities closed with a live show by DJ Habibeats. “Ascend Fest is the manifestation of the community’s talents and identities,” says Skye Lee, Nike Director of North America Strategy and Co-Chair of the Ascend Network. “Historically, the MENA, Pacific Island, and Asian communities have hidden parts of our identities to assimilate into American culture, but Ascend has been on a journey to unpack that. Ascend Fest is a platform to unapologetically embrace everything that we represent. Organizing events with so many like-minded, talented people is something I love about the NikeUNITED networks.”Learn more about our employee-led communities here: https://lnkd.in/gcxyit3Shashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#LifeAtNike hashtag#Ascend hashtag#NikeUnitedPhoto Credits: Amy Sakurai and Brian Valdez

"On this National Intern Day, we’re excited to celebrate the meaningful contributions of the more than 300 students who are part of the NIKE, Inc. Internship Program across the globe. Many of those contributions were on display during last week’s annual “Intern Combine” — four-day competition where a subset of our U.S.-based interns work in cross-functional teams to reimagine areas of growth for NIKE, Inc., present their ideas and receive feedback from Nike, Jordan and Converse leaders. Beyond the Combine, all of our interns take on meaningful projects specific to the business they support. To close out their programs, this talented group of undergraduate and graduate students presents their learnings to leaders and teammates, sharing creative solutions intended to make a big impact. “This has been such a challenging, yet rewarding experience,” says Shantelle Megan Serafin, an undergraduate at UC San Diego who is interning as a software engineer in Global Technology. “You’re working with a diverse group of people with different skill sets, coming together to create something new.” That diversity of thought, fresh perspectives and creativity are key to why the Internship Program serves as a critical pipeline for emerging NIKE, Inc. talent. The interns not only represent the athletes we serve, but the mindset we need to continue to embrace.

"The WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) preseason kicks off tomorrow, but the fourth cohort of Women in Nike [WIN] is already a few months into translating their experience as professional basketball players to NIKE, Inc.’s World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, as full-time employees. And WIN is growing: This year’s cohort has expanded to include USA Track & Field athletes, a first for the program.The WIN fellows bring their skills and insights from the highest levels of sport over to NIKE. Through a two-year, full-time role matched to the passions and experiences of the fellows, the program is helping build the next generation of talent here at the company. In short, WIN makes NIKE better.“We’ve all accomplished incredible things in track and basketball,” says Geena Levoe, Nike Footwear Analyst and a former pro 800-meter runner who represented the United States in London 2012. “Now, we’re on the other side of those careers, and we get to give back to the next generation of athletes. Competing, winning: That was what we were born to do. Now we have another purpose that matches Nike’s maxim of serving athletes. It’s powerful stuff.”Nicole Bush, Nike Associate Merchant for Kids/Boys Performance, now uses many of the skills that made her the 2013 American champion in the steeplechase: leadership, resilience, hard work and a sense of purpose.“We have a high baseline for doing things. That’s why the program exists,” she says. “NIKE trusts that our baseline as athletes can help the whole company grow through our ability to lead, to think outside of the box and to innovate.”NIKE needs the best and the brightest employees to help bring sport to athletes everywhere — people like Yolanda Moore, M.S., who won back-to-back titles with the WNBA’s Houston Comets in the late ’90s. She’s also a published author, life coach and Ph.D. candidate in instructional systems and workplace development. She now works in footwear product testing with Jordan Brand.Moore says the program’s expansion to other sports reflects the same mindset that her cohort brought to the court and the track: Never settle. Always consider how an individual, team or whole company can improve. Then get after it.“Creating space for us as the voice of the athlete and then respecting what we bring will continue defining the program as it grows to more sports,” says Moore. “We’ve got some dope women here. Open the gate. Let us do what we do.”Learn more about the program here: https://lnkd.in/gXRjky_rhashtag#LifeAtNike hashtag#NikeDEI hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#WomenOfNike hashtag#SwooshLife

"When babies learn to walk, it’s like going from 0 to 100 — they GO. Parents know best of all how quickly toddlers morph from crawling to walking. So when Fanny Yung Ho became a parent herself, she realized she was in a unique position to design product that helped promote the early walking patterns for our littlest athletes.“As a footwear designer with 15 years of experience, I realized I actually have the skillset and the expertise to help design a better product for toddlers learning to walk,” says Fanny, a Nike Senior Manager in Design Innovation, NXT. “My teammates approached some of our colleagues on the knit team and asked how we could create a seamless, 360-degree Flyknit bootie.

"How do you follow up on one of the most pivotal sporting moments for women’s football? You follow through. Last week, Nike and Football Australia announced a 10-year contract extension, which will continue to support all levels of the game in the country, from Australia’s elite national teams, the Matildas and Socceroos (senior, youth, para), through to grassroots programs. Nike’s investment will also focus on Football Australia’s Legacy ’23 strategy, increasing access to the game for young girls and women. This strategy is driven by an audacious goal: to make football the nation’s first sport to reach gender parity in participation. Bold? Yes. Possible? Absolutely — especially when passionate people on both sides are committed to dreaming big.  For Chris Incoll, Nike Sports Marketing Lead in Pacific Australia, his day-to-day work demands this kind of thinking, alongside national leagues and organizations, to bring about lasting change. The momentum created by the past two major tournaments for the men in 2022 and women in 2023 is just the beginning. “It’s a privilege to work closely with Football Australia to build generational impact across the sport,” says Chris. “I strongly believe in the power of sport to bring people together and change their communities for the better. Delivering on a shared vision and purpose with Football Australia has been the highlight of my 13-year career at Nike.”Learn more about our extended partnership: https://lnkd.in/gMde92FRhashtag#NikeFootball hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#GrowTheGame

"“This history is too important to the fabric of our nation to be forgotten.” That sentiment from Joanne Bland, co-founder and former director of the National Voting Rights Museum, set the tone for a special MLK Day Fireside Chat last week with Willie Gregory, Nike Senior Director of Community & Business Investment. Leading the conversation was Karol Collymore (she/her), Nike Senior Director of Inclusive Community for Social & Community Impact. Preserving our past is paramount for Willie and Joanne, who shared their own stories about growing up in the South during the Civil Rights Movement. Willie shared his memory of being at a high school track practice in Memphis when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel, a site which is now preserved as part of the National Civil Rights Museum. For Willie, a member of Nike’s Black Community Commitment task force, “You don’t know where you need to go if you don’t know where you’ve been.”  Joanne was just 11 years old when she joined what was supposed to be a peaceful protest and march from George Washington Carver Homes, where she lived in Selma, Alabama, to the state capitol of Montgomery on March 7, 1965, what would become known as “Bloody Sunday.” She’s been educating others and fighting for civil rights and social justice ever since. She recently founded Foot Soldiers Park, a Nike-supported nonprofit that serves as a place — located at the housing projects where her march began — to memorialize the foot soldiers of the 1960s and teach others about the Civil Rights Movement and today’s social justice imperatives. “When a foot soldier dies, a whole library is gone, because his story is different than mine. Her story is different than mine. And all our stories are important,” said Joanne. “There’s no reason that when your great-grandchildren come to Selma, they shouldn’t have a chance to hear me tell my story. And Nike’s helping me make that happen.” Please join us in honoring the life and legacy of Dr. King today by stepping up, speaking out and doing something positive to empower others in your community.

"Cathy Swearengen-Duncan, an area manager at the Nike Distribution Center in Memphis, is no stranger to doing good work for her community. Growing up in North Memphis, Cathy’s parents were local apartment managers, she spent lots of time at the Hollywood Community Center after school and she had several relatives who were involved in local politics. She learned early-on the importance of community, giving back and trying to lift up those around you. So when Cathy was given an opportunity to join her local Employee Grant Selection Committee for the Nike Community Impact Fund (NCIF), Nike’s employee-led, neighborhood-focused approach to grant-making, she couldn’t say yes fast enough. “Whenever anyone is looking for volunteers, I raise my hand. It just matters to me,” she says. Each committee member is trained on how to assess grant applications, and then they share their insights — as individuals who live, work and play in the areas they’re representing — to decide which organizations should receive funding. She's reviewed between 75 and 80 applications. Even as someone who volunteers frequently, she says, she was overjoyed that there were so many people who wanted to help others in the community. The review process is time-consuming, but it wasn’t the hours logged that proved to be the most difficult part for Cathy. The committee members had to ask themselves some tough questions to make their final selections: How many people are they trying to help? How are they engaging kids? What’s their lasting impact? While each Nike teammate can only serve on their local NCIF Employee Grant Selection Committee once, Cathy is committed to finding other ways she can continue to make a difference through Nike. “Every time I go out into the community and meet someone connected to a nonprofit, I spread the word about NCIF and tell them to submit an application,” she says. “To see Nike help support these nonprofits in doing their work is amazing.” Learn more about the Nike Community Impact Fund at https://lnkd.in/eFqiD3YV hashtag#NCIF hashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt

That’s why Nike and Dove have partnered to launch Body Confident Sport, a first-of-its-kind set of tools for coaching 11- to 17-year-old girls that will help build their body confidence and make them feel like sport is a place where they belong.We know coaches are uniquely positioned to help positively influence girls’ perceptions of their bodies, and this new tool is scientifically proven to improve self-esteem and body confidence for girls. “The efficacy of this program is a huge part of why we are so eager to get it into the hands of coaches everywhere — it works!” says Kelsey Moore, Made to Play Director for North America Social and Community Impact, who worked closely on the partnership. “This project has also transformed my own mindset. As the mother of two young daughters, I plan to model body confidence and do everything in my power to ensure their sport experience is one that helps them reap all the benefits.

"Nike’s Business Diversity & Inclusion (BDI) program addresses a straightforward question: How can Nike work with more diverse suppliers? After launching its first North American cohort, Nike BDI is expanding to the City of Lights. Like in North America, Nike’s Parisian BDI program is manifested in the Academy, a four-month program that brings together 15 diverse-owned agencies to address opportunities from the Nike Paris Marketing team ahead of next summer's games in France. Covering event planning and communications, these agencies represent ethnic minority and immigrant-owned, women-owned and disabled-owned businesses. The Academy culminates with a graduation in early 2024. Bruna Braga van Bree, Nike Lead for Procurement Programs in EMEA, leads a team that’s setting a national precedent for supplier diversity in a large company. The data behind supplier diversity isn’t as widely available in Europe as it is in North America, says Bruna, so she and her teammates led a detailed, from-scratch strategy and partnered with diverse supplier advocacy groups who are also leading the industry in France. “BDI is not purely a corporate social responsibility, purpose, or procurement initiative, separate from how the core business works,” says Bruna. “Our program is embedded in Nike’s business model. And it’s putting money in the hands of business owners who, in turn, help make Nike a better company."" Before Nike, Bruna spent a decade working in the nonprofit sector. She finds great personal inspiration in her work, she says, because it brings a sense of purpose to everyday business decisions. “I think about one of the maxims here at Nike: 'Win as a team,'” says Bruna. “No one company is going to solve a problem like underrepresentation of diverse businesses by itself,” says Bruna. “Every company can work with diverse suppliers and be part of the solution.” Learn more about Nike’s North American BDI Academy Program here: https://lnkd.in/gBauGUJfhashtag#SwooshLife hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#WinAsATeam hashtag#NikeBDI

"Sabrina Ionescu keeps breaking records. She just became the first player in WNBA history to reach 600 assists and 600 rebounds through her first four seasons. This came after she set the all time three-point contest record for both men and women in the All-Star Game. Today, she hits another milestone: the global launch of the Nike Sabrina 1, her first signature shoe.Ben Nethongkome, Nike's lead designer for the Sabrina 1, credits the excitement around the shoe to the group effort among the Nike Basketball team, and especially to Sabrina herself.“The stars aligned for us with Sabrina,” says Nethongkome. “You have a generational player, who has a deep connection to Nike and Oregon, who’s actively partnering with us to grow the women’s game and serve all players. Our work across design, product development and marketing all flowed organically. When one of the best players in the world partners with one of the best brands in the world, you get a special shoe.”Learn more about the Sabrina 1 at https://lnkd.in/gaPTZ2P3hashtag#NikeBasketball hashtag#Sabrina1 hashtag#JustDoIt

"We know kids do better when they have access to sport. The 2023 Nike Community Impact Fund (NCIF) is ready to help make that happen in the communities where our employees live, work and play.Since 2009, NCIF has awarded $11 million through 1,200-plus grants to grassroots nonprofits that help create active communities and get kids moving. This year, we’ll continue to drive local impact with more than $1.7 million in grants to support local programs in key cities and employee backyards across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan.  What makes the program so special: We invite our employees to share their local insights and play a leading role in choosing the grantees — because no one knows what their neighborhood needs more than the people who live there. “It was a tremendous experience to help my community,” says Michael Buford, a Data Analyst for Nike Corporate Information Services based in St. Louis, who was a part of the employee committee last year for Nike Air Manufacturing Innovation in St. Charles, Missouri. He helped select Color Coded Kids and Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis, among other nonprofits, for a 2022 NCIF grant. “Having the chance to give back in a community I grow up in and seeing some of the changes that were made with the funds — from back-to-school supplies to restocking for food pantries to a reading lab for one of the inner-city schools — was a joy.” An organization in your neighborhood can be part of that positive impact too. Applications are open now for eligible nonprofits, community organizations and schools at about.nike.com/ncif “If you have the opportunity to give back, and you have a voice to express where the funds are being used, take on that task,” encourages Buford. Or in other words? “Just do it!” he says. hashtag#NikeCommunityImpactFund hashtag#nonprofits hashtag#justdoit

"In 2013, after being promoted to a head coach in Barstow, Calif., Jose Miranda got a call from his regional director. His team had won an area-wide contest, and as the leader, Jose won a round-trip vacation to anywhere in the United States. But Jose thinks like a local changemaker. Nike’s community involvement at its retail locations was the main reason that led him to the company in 2012 as a coach at the Las Vegas store. He knew that the Barstow store partnered closely with the nearby Boys & Girls Club, which was still using old, worn-down sports equipment. “I asked my director what the amount for the trip was, and he said about $3,500,” says Jose. “Nike retail is all about inspiring action right where you are. I wanted my job with Nike to serve something bigger than just myself. For a lot of people, Nike stores are their main impression of the brand. I wanted Nike to be known in our community as a retail brand that was doing good.” A week later, Jose rolled into the Boys & Girls Club facility, the back of his truck filled with $3,500 worth of sports balls, football helmets, and other shiny new gear. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Word of Jose’s generosity got around to Nike World Headquarters, prompting another phone call from Jose’s regional director. The company was flying him to Beaverton to share his story of generosity with Nike executive leaders at a meeting. “While I was on stage, one of the Nike leaders said the company had a gift for me,” Jose says. It was a giant cardboard check for $3,500, the same amount he had given back to his community. Jose is now a regional district director in Chandler, Arizona, where he’s helping grow the network of stores throughout the state. He’s still inspiring his store athletes to serve the needs of the local community and to respond with real action, just like he did in Barstow. Sound like a career you want to be a part of?

"Jenna Etherington joined NIKE, Inc. in 2011 as an Assistant Head Coach in San Clemente, Calif., and has since built a stellar career in retail. She was promoted to Head Coach in part due to “stretch” assignments, opportunities for NIKE employees to grow their toolkit and gain different experiences by working on another team.Now, as the Area Director for NIKE’s South LA and Orange County stores, Jenna uses the NIKE Track Stretch HQ program to pay it forward and ensure her teams can access career-propelling assignments. Track Stretch HQ is a six-month development experience available to all retail teammates. Participants travel to work in different NIKE territories in Beaverton, Los Angeles, New York City and Chicago, where they develop critical skills and explore different career paths and specializations. At the end of the stretch experience, they return to their store and former roles with new experiences gained and relationships built. Many use their Track Stretch HQ experience to continue building their careers in retail or at NIKE headquarters. Jenna says more than 50 people from the stores she oversees have participated in Track Stretch roles. At least half have landed a new role, often earning a promotion. A stretch rounds out skills and can help clarify career direction. From Jenna’s perspective, Track Stretch is also a critical way to level the playing field. “The minute Track Stretch HQ launched, it allowed everybody to have the same career-building options, regardless of the store or marketplace they worked in,” says Jenna. Because retail employees earn a salary for their stretch role, she says it can be financially life-changing for many people. “There is a home for everyone at NIKE—whether they want to work in product innovation, engineering or retail—we can find it.” Sound like the kind of company you want to be a part of?

"Shawn Harvey, Assistant Head Coach at the NIKE Factory Store in Orange, CA, prides himself on being a “jack of all trades,” ensuring everything at the store – from logistics and merchandising to customer experience – runs smoothly. Shawn was looking for ways to grow his career at NIKE when he received an email to join a professional development program that partners NIKE Retail teammates with our Tech and Digital teams. The program’s rationale is simple: Retail insights lead to stronger digital experiences for customers, while new skills and connections help employees grow their professional circle.  Shawn spent a few months embedded in an app creation team at NIKE’s World Headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. Specifically, he helped the app team figure out how to create a more connected experience for store athletes across NIKE’s retail apps.  While at WHQ, Shawn earned his “Scrum Master” certificate, learning more about project management, iterative progress, accountability and team performance. He knew the skills would be beneficial – “Now in my store, I dissect all our tasks using Scrum principles, taking out all the noise and nonsense so it’s easier for my team to succeed.” After completing this professional development program, many participants use their experience to grow in the retail environment or pursue roles elsewhere in the company. “As you gain more responsibility in your job, it’s easy to lose sight of your personal career development,” he says. “NIKE’s professional development programs overall have been pivotal for me in growing as a leader.” Nike’s Firstline teammates have different ways to grow and develop on the job. Programs like Track Stretch Retail, Track Stretch HQ and District Community Championship (to name a few) range from 15 weeks to two years in duration. They focus on skill building and leadership development while exposing participants to different parts of the job and the company. Sound like the kind of company you want to be a part of?

"Iris Pakingan knows what great mentorship looks like. After a decade in corporate environments, leading a non-profit and mentoring diverse groups of people, it's the mentors she’s had at Nike that have led her to build a career at the company. Iris is a director based out of ReLAy, Nike’s first regional service center focused exclusively on online order fulfillment, and she contributes her mentors for the growth she’s experienced. “My leaders have been authentic and engaged, ensuring I can fully be myself at work,"" she says. “They've cared enough to challenge me and also have taken to heart how I want to grow my career.” For Iris, that growth included pursuing a graduate degree. Nike’s tuition assistance plan covered part of the cost, helping Iris graduate debt free. But it was the support of her leaders that helped make balancing work and school possible. They cared about her goals and worked to provide a flexible schedule to support her in earning the degree. “At one point, I had two required in-person classes, 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., while working full-time and living an hour’s commute from the school campus,” she says. “If I had stuck to that setup, I wouldn’t have found the time to commute, much less sleep or make my 3:45 a.m. start time. So, I asked my manager if I could work four ten-hour days instead to rebalance the load. He fully supported me, and I did that for eight weeks — the duration of the classes.” As soon as she graduated, Iris took a new operations manager role, putting her in a position to help start Nike’s regional service network as part of its supply chain transformation. With a promotion to her current role as Director, she’s now leading the development of new strategic capabilities to evolve Nike’s regional service center network. For Iris, Nike embodies her beliefs about leadership, community and people. Through drive, perseverance and the help of others, she created a career in Los Angeles—the city she loves—and considers it a privilege to be in a position where she can support teammates like she’s been supported. She also wants to keep learning. “I had such a positive experience with the tuition reimbursement and with my mentors supporting me, that I’m considering getting my doctorate in Business Administration,” she says. “It’s rare to get the kind of flexibility that you can experience at Nike, and I know that I’ve got the great managers to support my journey.” Sound like the kind of company you want to be a part of?

"The Nike InfinityRN 4 launched last week with a breakthrough technology: Nike ReactX foam. ReactX gives runners more energy return — about 13% — than Nike React Foam while leaving a much lower carbon footprint — 43% to be exact. Sounds simple enough, right? Except that the chemistry required to make those two things exist simultaneously is really complicated, requiring a dream team of chemists, scientists, engineers and cushioning experts.That dream team was a real-life roster for Golnaz Armin, Nike VP, Footwear, Material Innovation. Armin’s team worked for the better part of five years to reconcile traits that are seemingly at odds: performance and sustainability. She says she loves how the entire team was compelled by the setbacks of the design process, not turned off by them. An issue in a prototype just meant that a better solution was around the corner. The mutual determination shared by a team of brilliant, like-minded people is one reason why ReactX is a success story. “I’m at Nike because of the people,” says Armin. “They’re the best at what they do, the best in their fields. All of the challenges we faced along the way could’ve stopped us from moving forward, but our team's resilience and expertise carried us through.""

"After getting married in 2017, Katherine McLennan and her husband Kyle were excited to start a family. Unfortunately, the couple learned that getting pregnant on their own might not be in the cards.During what she describes as one of the roughest periods of her life, Katherine, a Coach at the Nike Factory Store in Lakewood, Colo., went through three rounds of IVF that ended in multiple miscarriages. “My eggs weren’t viable,” says Katherine. “It became clear we would need additional support, whether that was an egg donor or even somebody to carry a child for us.” That's when Katherine turned to Progyny, Inc. Through its partnership with Progyny, NIKE, Inc. provides employees with family-building benefits like fertility treatment, adoption and surrogacy coverage. Teammates have access to unlimited ‘Smart Cycles’ for fertility services like IVF, egg retrieval, and more. Progyny made the whole process simple for Katherine and Kyle. They were paired with a dedicated Patient Care Advocate, who listened effectively and with the help of their fertility specialist, aligned on a plan. “The day that we found out we matched with our preferred donor was one of the most exciting days of my life,” Katherine recalls. “We ended up getting four viable embryos, and the first implantation turned into a healthy pregnancy. After so many years navigating disappointments and heartache, we could finally bask in the joy that we were going to be parents.”In June 2022, The McLennans were ecstatic to welcome baby Serena into their lives. The newly-turned one-year-old has brought so much joy. Katherine and Kyle can’t imagine life without her.“We wouldn’t be a family without Nike and Progyny,"" she says.

"After home-schooling their five-year-old son Angelo throughout Covid, Mariana Psarianos and her husband started looking for someone to help Angelo adjust to some changes, like starting at a new school. Initially, Mariana had little success, facing long wait times and high costs. Then she read about NIKE, Inc.’s RethinkCare benefit in a Nike Families newsletter.Through RethinkCare, U.S. employees and their families have 24/7 access to unlimited consultations and personalized support from dedicated learning and behavior experts, and access to online tools and resources to help parents and children better communicate with each other. There are no age restrictions and all associated fees are covered by Nike. Mariana’s RethinkCare coach helped Angelo navigate challenges, from trying new foods to adjusting to new teachers and classmates. She educated the family about developmentally-appropriate sports, and how to change their day-to-day communication to be more kid-friendly. “Our family now has a shared language to talk about big emotions, and my son is super into it because he loves superheroes,” says Mariana, a Product Manager in North America Operations and Logistics. “For example, he can connect an emotion to Glass Man, who breaks at the smallest thing, or Super Flex, who uses flexible thinking to succeed. It makes me so happy to hear him telling himself, ‘I can think of a way to solve this problem.’ It takes a village to raise a child and I’m so thankful that RethinkCare is a part of ours.”Learn more about how Nike supports employees and their families at https://lnkd.in/g8Wi4tbPhoto Credit: Joshua Sondelskihashtag#NikeBenefits hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#SwooshLife

"“I was dealing with postpartum depression after having my last baby,” says Christy Hairston, West Territory Nike Athlete Experience (NAX) Trainer based in LA. “As a mother of four, I had dealt with postpartum before, but this time, it felt different. My husband was incredibly supportive but he suggested I might need more help than just him. That’s when I decided to check out Lyra.”  Through NIKE, Inc.’s partnership with Lyra Health, employees and their eligible dependents receive free, confidential coaching and therapy sessions, plus access to mental wellness tools and self-guided care. For Christy, it was easy to sign up. There was no waiting period, and it was convenient to fit virtual sessions into her schedule.One perk of Nike’s Lyra benefit is selecting your own therapist or coach, an aspect that Christy described as a “game changer.” Lyra prioritizes diversity and has a network of providers representing different backgrounds, lived experiences and identities. “Having the ability to choose my provider made a huge difference for me as a woman of color,” she shares. “I wanted someone I could identify with – someone who understood the complexities in my life and who could go deep with me into my emotions, like the trauma of being in labor and not having the doctor listen to me because I am Black.”  “Now, I am becoming the person I envision – fully me emotionally, physically, and mentally.” Learn more about how Nike supports employees and their families here: https://lnkd.in/g8Wi4tb hashtag#NikeBenefits hashtag#JustDoIt hashtag#WorldMaternalMentalHealthDay Photo Credit: Joshua Sondelski

"Nohán Cruz, CDR and his wife were facing a common problem: how to afford sending their sons to college. Luckily, Nohán, a Territory Recruiting Lead in Los Angeles, remembered a call he had with NIKE, Inc. HR about the financial coaching available to employees through EY Navigate™.Through EY, NIKE provides free, unlimited financial coaching and education to all U.S.-based employees and their spouse or domestic partner. Employees can choose from a diverse team of credentialed financial coaches who are trained on NIKE’s pay and benefits, and get assistance with retirement planning, college savings, or simply putting together a household budget. Looking for help, Nohán dialed the number.  “That one phone call unlocked a lot of opportunities for us in how to plan a future for our boys,” he says. “It was a reality check. We had to answer some hard questions, like what are our needs versus our wants. But we knew we had to answer those questions if we wanted to open a door for our boys to go to college.” Nohán and his wife put some new habits into practice to save money. Now, their eldest son has a Portland State degree in Physics, working as a Systems Integration Engineer. Their youngest is wrapping up a successful freshman year at El Camino College. Today Nohán is excited to help his teammates understand the full range of benefits available to employees. The biggest impact of the phone call, he says, was knowledge. “My advice to other NIKE employees is to learn about all the benefits that are available to you,” says Nohán. “Lean into the people who know it.

"A planetary physicist by training, Eric King joined Nike’s Advanced Innovation Center as Exploration Director to make real, sustainable change on a systemic level. He’s also one of the internal experts whose thoughts are featured in our new book, “No Finish Line,” Nike’s design vision for the next 50 years.  According to Eric, when you're thinking about systems innovation, it's super easy to get bogged down. But one of the most important and meaningful things you can do is paint a vision for what the future could be. “I came to Nike because I think some of this change needs to come from the private sector and Nike is uniquely capable of driving change on a mass scale,"" says Eric. ""If we can show what that future looks like and start acting on it, we can bring the whole industry with us. And if we change our industry, it's likely that adjacent industries will come along too.” For more insight into Nike’s culture of innovation — and our athletes’, designers’ and scientists’ hopes for the future — pick up a copy of “No Finish Line,” out today from Actual Source and in select bookstores around the world.
