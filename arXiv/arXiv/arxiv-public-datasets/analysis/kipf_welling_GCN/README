I cloned the GCN from https://github.com/tkipf/gcn, which is where most of the files come
from. I added "cast_arxiv....py", which puts the arXiv data in the right form. It grabs the
arxiv data from various directories. Specifically,

line 190: grabs the citation.json.
line 211: grabs the vector embeddings for the titles and abstract (didn't implement full text
yet). 

These will have to be edited.

I also added the GCN_classification file, which simply calls the trainer.py (which comes from
Kipf's github). It also dumps the output of the classification into the results/ directory. See
the trainer.py file for other training options (num of epochs, etc).

The GCN is a semi-supervised method, meaning some nodes are missing labels. For the subset
of the arXiv we're looking at, we have all the labels. So, I set the unlabeld population to
zero. This is achieved by setting cutoff1 = cutoff2 = 0.9  (line 222 in "cast_arxiv..."). See
the "load_data" function in the utils.py file, for how the dataset is partitioned.
